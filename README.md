# Stocks-Web-Crawler !

The aim of this project is to design and develop a database for the customers to get relevant information about stocks and maintain a record of interested stocks. It also maintains customer database as well as stocks’ real-time database. Alerts and updates of subscribed stocks are sent to the customers via their registered emails.

Stock data needs to be up to date. This could be achieved by scrapping the data off the Google search engine. Web scrapping was applied on Google’s search engine and the data was fed into the database on a timely basis.

Java Applets and Java Swing have been to used to design the front – end GUI which is basically a Windows Application. JFrames, JLabels, and many other Java Swing components have been used to develop the front end of the project.

Apache Derby (an inbuilt database tool inside NetBeans 8) has been used to design the database system.
